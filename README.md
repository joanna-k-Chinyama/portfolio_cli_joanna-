  #what i learned
    -importance of version contral 
    -The impoetance of writing clear easy to read code.
    -error handling

  #what i struggled with
    -writing the codition to have  loop continue running until the user clicks exit. turns out one of the condition in the loop inside the do while loop was clushing with the do while loop condition satement hence affecting the entire app.
